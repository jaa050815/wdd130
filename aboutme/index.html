    <h2>Alex Arch</h2>
    <p>I am working on my degree for Computer Information Technology, but I want to go into Cybersecurity.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include playing the Cello as well as reading. </p>
    <p>The reason I am taking this course is because I need to for my degree, but also because I want to. I am interested in web design and am excited for this course this semester.</p>
    <p>One interesting fact about me is that I am colorblind.</p>
