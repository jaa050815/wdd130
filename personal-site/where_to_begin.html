            <h2>Books</h2>
            <p>To begin playing you will need a couple of things. First, you need 3 books. The player's handbook, the DM’s guide, and the monster manual. These 3 books will include everything you need to get started playing the game including character creation rules, guides for the DM, and enemies that you will find on your adventures.</p>
            <h2>People</h2>
            <p>You will also need a group of people to play with. A great place to start is with your friends. It’s always more fun to play with people you know and it’s always a good time when you do it with your friends.</p>

            <h2>Dice</h2>
            <p>To start playing, everyone playing the game will need a set of dice. The dice are what allow the players and DM to see if their actions are successful or not. Dice can be found almost anywhere. Just make sure it’s a set of D&D dice. They may look a little funky to new players, but the more you use them the more used to them you will become.</p>
