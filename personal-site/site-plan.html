        What is D&D? 
        D&D 5e is a collaborative game played with a group of friends. It revolves around imagination and storytelling. Together the players will create a story that allows them to experience the world of fantasy. There are no limits to the storytelling power of D&D players. They can do anything, go anywhere, and experience anything they want to. The only limit is their imagination.  

        What is a DM?  
        One person from the group will be named the DM. They create the world and the story that the others will experience. The players themselves can choose what to do, then the DM narrates the consequences of their actions. This allows for limitless potential. The story can go anywhere. It is an experience created by the DM and the players working together to create stories. 

        What are characters? 
        Together players create the characters they will play. The characters you create will be the medium by which you interact with the D&D world. Every character is different, and you can make them whatever you want. It’s a good idea for players to make their characters as a group, so the characters go well together. Players should create characters they will have fun playing.  

        Why play? 
        D&D is a unique experience that allows you to use your imagination and be creative. D&D is also a great way to collaborate with others and use your mind positively. You can let your imagination and creativity run wild. It allows you to have experiences that will last a lifetime. It’s important to remember that D&D is a game. The most important reason for playing is to have fun!

      <h3>Where to Begin</h3>
      <p>
        What do I need to play? 
        Books 
        To begin playing you will need a couple of things. First, you need 3 books. The player's handbook, the DM’s guide, and the monster manual. These 3 books will include everything you need to get started playing the game including character creation rules, guides for the DM, and enemies that you will find on your adventures.  

        People 
        You will also need a group of people to play with. A great place to start is with your friends. It’s always more fun to play with people you know and it’s always a good time when you do it with your friends.  

        Dice 
        To start playing, everyone playing the game will need a set of dice. The dice are what allow the players and DM to see if their actions are successful or not. Dice can be found almost anywhere. Just make sure it’s a set of D&D dice. They may look a little funky to new players, but the more you use them the more used to them you will become.

      </ul>
      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>  
        How many people do you need to play? 
        D&D can be played with anywhere from 2 to 8 players. There is no set minimum or limit, but generally, it is good to play with around 4 or 5 players.  

        Does everyone need their own books and dice? 
        Usually, all players will have their own set of dice. This makes the game smoother because players won’t have to share dice. Not everyone needs to buy a set of dice, but everyone should have one they can use. One set of books is enough for a group of players. Not everyone needs their own books, the players can share them.  

        Do all players need to be present to play?  
        D&D stories often take place over multiple games. Every game the players will pick up where they left off. It is better if all the players are together when they play, but it’s not a necessity. If someone can’t make it to a game, then the DM can come up with a creative reason for their character not participating in the adventure.
