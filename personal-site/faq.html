            <h2>How many people do you need to play?</h2>
            <p>D&D can be played with anywhere from 2 to 8 players. There is no set minimum or limit, but generally, it is good to play with around 4 or 5 players.</p>
            <h2>Does everyone need their own books and dice?</h2>
            <p>Usually, all players will have their own set of dice. This makes the game smoother because players won’t have to share dice. Not everyone needs to buy a set of dice, but everyone should have one they can use. One set of books is enough for a group of players. Not everyone needs their own books, the players can share them.</p>
            <h2>Do all players need to be present to play?</h2>
            <p>D&D stories often take place over multiple games. Every game the players will pick up where they left off. It is better if all the players are together when they play, but it’s not a necessity. If someone can’t make it to a game, then the DM can come up with a creative reason for their character not participating in the adventure.</p>
